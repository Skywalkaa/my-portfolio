    "bio1": "I am an AI & Data Science engineering student in my 3rd year at Télécom SudParis, currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at École Polytechnique. I have a strong foundation in mathematics, machine learning, deep learning, NLP, and computer vision, with hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.",
    "bio2": "Through my previous internships and projects, I applied these skills to impactful challenges: medical image segmentation with advanced architectures (Mamba & MedNeXt), the development of language models for Indigenous languages of Canada using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and predictive real-estate modeling at Avito.ma. In each of these, I distinguished myself as a key contributor, with several works recognized by awards and prizes.",
    "bio3": "Autonomous, rigorous, and results-driven, I value clean code, reproducible experiments, and teamwork. I am fluent in French and English, strengthened by international experiences that enhanced my adaptability and cross-cultural collaboration.",
